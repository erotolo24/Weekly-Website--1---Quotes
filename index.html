              One of the greatest guitar shredders to ever walk the Earth, and coming from one of the greatest 80's rock bands ever, Eddie Van Halen certainly was an important role in guitar and rock history.

          <h2>
            <div>“Rock stars come and go. Musicians play until they die”</div>
          </h2>
            <div><p>Eddie loved his music, he didn't do it for the fame or the money, he did it because it was his soul. He wasn't exactly for the idea of 'rock stars' despite he was one of the biggest during that era. Eddie believed in true musical talent and hard work, not just quick fame from a one-hit wonder. He is saying that real musicians stick with their talents forever until they can't, and the idea of 'rock stars' is just a quick passing-by which can be reached by publishing yourself enough.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>
            <div>“To hell with the rules. If it sounds right, then it is.”</div>
          </h2>
          <div><p>
            Sometimes when writing music, the rules of music theory just seems so restrictive and complex. Eddie Van Halen was an extremely diverse guitarist who utilized techniques such as tapping like no other, and he was not one for rules. He's just using music as an example to say it's completely cool to go outside of the box to get your ideas done and while doing it creatively. There is a reason why no one was able to make such medleys like Eddie, he was all for creativity and to screw the rules of music!

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2><div>
            “If you want to be a rock star or just be famous, then run down the street naked, you’ll make the news or something. But if you want music to be your livelihood, then play, play, play, and play! And eventually you’ll get to where you want to be.”</div>
          </h2>
          <div><p>
            A bit more lengthy for a quote from Eddie, but this again identifies the idea of a 'rock star' versus a real dedicated musician. This quote of his shows the difference between the need for any fame, or the need to bring out your creativity and talent to the world through what you truly love doing best. Eddie Van Halen was not one desperate for fame, instead, he had a desire to bring out his prodigious skills to the world of music and to change the scene of rock forever.
